## Future Work (Approach For Training LLM Using Synthetic Data)

In anticipation of harnessing the full potential of the LLM for the business-spacific tasks in the future, I have adopted an approach by storing synthetic data produced by the LLM in conjunction with the prompts or queries issued to it. This is being systematically stored in integrated database. 

No doubt, LLMs are great at handling a wide range of topics,but LLMs might not always be perfect for business specific tasks. There is a need of Surpvised Training of LLM for business specific tasks.

To do this without increasing costs or needing more people, I have come up with a smart method. I am carefully saving the prompt and its answers by LLM. Think of it like collecting a dataset of specific business-related tasks. With this approach, every prompt and response is like a training lesson, for LLM and the best part is, I am generating and saving synthetic data without extra work and involvement of Human resources i.e Data Annotators.

The big picture is simple: When I have enough of these saved conversations, I can use them to better train the LLM. I want it to really understand the specific business needs. By training the LLM with this data, the LLM will not just have general knowledge but will be better at helping in unique business situation.

In conclusion, by combining the LLM's broad knowledge with my collected data, I am aiming to create a tool that is not only advanced but also perfectly suited to specific business needs and how I operate.

If I had more time, I would have added a Feedback loop in my app.
